          <p text-align="center"> Hi,i am hardworking lady and i love when my fingers are typing on my laptop. i finished my hight school last year(2018) and i was doing MCE(Maths,Economics and computer scince).
            Seeing ICT growing in Rwanda every day, it's hard to ignore all the possibilities for our future! that's why i choose MCE combination in high school.
            My purpose is to become a role model for others, and become a living testimony of what women can achieve.
            One of my biggest dreams is to see a greater number of girls in the software field, and i choose Moringa school to learn more about program.
            One day I hope to establish an academy that will focus on helping youth discover their latent talent and develop the can-do spirit that I have.
            I am looking forward for more skills about software in university more training and more internaship inorder to grow tall in programing.
            All in all i believe that Moringa School opened a door for me towards my dream, which is to see change in my society."
